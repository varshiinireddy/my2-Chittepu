# VARSHINI CHITTEPU
 
I once participated in a hot air balloon festival and had the opportunity to help inflate and launch a hot air balloon. Floating high above the picturesque landscape at sunrise was not only breathtaking but also a truly surreal experience. It ignited my fascination with aviation and the beauty of the world from a different perspective.
