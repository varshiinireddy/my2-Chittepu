### Bora Bora

Feel the warm sand on your skin and let the gentle sounds of waves lull you into a blissful afternoon nap while lounging on Bora Bora’s beautiful **Matira Beach**. Or dive into the Maldives' pristine waters and wave to a passing whale shark. Pufferfish, lionfish, eagle rays and reef sharks swim by in blurs of color as you snorkel or scuba dive the country’s world-famous **Ari Atoll** and then recline beachside with a celebratory handcrafted cocktail. Revel in breathtaking ocean views and relaxation as you explore some of the world’s best beaches with Norwegian.
